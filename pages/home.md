The vision of the AIGOV project is to facilitate the implementation of fair, ethical, trustworthy, and robust, both from a technical and social perspective, Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems in Public Administration (PA) with a focus on users and those who may be affected. AIGOV envisions the wide exploitation of AI technologies in PA using the wealth of available government data (both open and closed data), while at the same time at maximizing social benefits, empowering PA employees, and mitigating relevant risks related to ethics, privacy, security and legislation, as well as AI transparency, understanding, and accuracy. AIGOV will enable PA to develop pathways for the adoption of AI, while also addressing the societal challenges and risks to be raised and establishing safeguards against bias and unfairness.
