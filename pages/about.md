The **vision of the AIGOV** project is to facilitate the implementation of fair, ethical, trustworthy, and robust, both from a technical and social perspective, Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems in Public Administration (PA) with a focus on users and those who may be affected. AIGOV envisions the wide exploitation of **AI technologies** in PA using the wealth of available **government data** (both open and closed data), while at the same time at maximizing social benefits, empowering PA employees, and mitigating relevant risks related to **ethics, privacy, security and legislation**, as well as AI transparency, understanding, and accuracy. AIGOV will enable PA to develop **pathways** for the adoption of AI, while also addressing the societal challenges and risks to be raised and establishing safeguards against bias and unfairness.
